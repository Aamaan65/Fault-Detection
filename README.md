# Fault-Detection
The system employs various machine learning models to analyze sensor data from equipment, identifying patterns and anomalies that indicate potential faults. This proactive approach to fault detection helps prevent costly downtime and extends the lifespan of machinery.


**Dataset : 
Our project has developed a MATLAB model to perform comprehensive fault analysis on a power system. The system configuration includes four generators, each with an output of 11 kV. These generators are strategically positioned in pairs at both ends of the transmission line. To facilitate detailed studies of various fault scenarios, transformers are installed at the midpoint of the transmission line.Under this setup, we simulate both normal and fault conditions to closely monitor how different faults affect the power system. The key outputs from these simulations are the line voltages and line currents, which are measured at the output side of the power system.For thorough analysis and future reference, we have gathered a substantial dataset comprising nearly 12,000 data points. Each data point is meticulously labeled to correspond with the specific conditions under which it was recorded. This dataset is crucial for our ongoing research and development in power system fault analysis.
